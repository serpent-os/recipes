summary     : Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions Library
description : |
    The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular expression pattern
    matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE2 has its own native API,
    as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API.
    The PCRE2 library is free, even for building proprietary software. It comes in three forms,
    for processing 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, in either literal or UTF encoding.
