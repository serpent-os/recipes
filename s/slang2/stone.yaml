summary     : S-Lang programmer's Library
description : |
    S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a developer to create robust multi-platform software.
    It provides facilities required by interactive applications such as display/screen management, keyboard input, keymaps,
    and so on. The most exciting feature of the library is the slang interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program
    to make it extensible. While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of the interpreter, it may also be
    used in a stand-alone fashion through the use of slsh, which is part of the S-Lang distribution.
