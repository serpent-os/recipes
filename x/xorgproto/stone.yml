summary     : X Window System unified protocol definitions
description : |
    This package provides the headers and specification documents defining
    the core protocol and (many) extensions for the X Window System. The
    extensions are those common among servers descended from X11R7. It
    also includes a number of headers that aren't purely protocol related,
    but are depended upon by many other X Window System packages to provide
    common definitions and porting layer.
