summary     : Free implementation of the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)
description : |
    Freeglut, the Free OpenGL Utility Toolkit, is meant to be a free alternative to Mark Kilgard's GLUT library. In short, freeglut can be used by OpenGL programs to perform those tasks which would normally require platform-specific code. Tasks like creating a window, creating an OpenGL context and binding it to the window, and processing input events. Freeglut provides a concise and elegant API to handle those tasks, in a platform-independent manner, keeping the application simple and portable. One of the main goals of freeglut, is maximum compatibility. Freeglut is both source and binary-compatible with the original GLUT, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for it. We take great care to maintain a stable API and ABI, and to introduce any new features and improvements in a way which does not compromise compatibility.
